# Hash Poisoning Attack and Steganography Attack with mitigation using MD5 Hash

### Use Case (Reference [link](https://towardsdatascience.com/black-box-attacks-on-perceptual-image-hashes-with-gans-cc1be11f277))
A system that allows users to submit photos to a database of images to ban. 
A human reviews the image to ensure it is an image that deserves banning (and that the image is say, not the Coca-Cola logo). If approved, this hash gets added to the database and is checked against whenever a new image is uploaded. If this new imageâ€™s hash collides with the banned hash, the image is prevented from being uploaded.
